# Character-Network

Character Network Analysis
Hey there! This repository contains code for extracting and analyzing character networks from works of fiction. A character network is a graph extracted from a narrative, in which vertices represent characters and edges correspond to interactions between them. A number of narrative-related problems can be addressed automatically through the analysis of character networks, such as summarization, classification, or role detection.

For starters, after web scraping to obtain a dataframe of all the characters of the series, I have performed very basic character analysis taking the example of book 7 of the Malazan Series: Reaper's Gale. The visualisation of the character network can be viewed using the .html file.

This project was inspired by Thu Vuâ€™s YouTube video on character network analysis for the witcher series.

The data folder needs to contain a malazan subfolder containing content of each of the books in .txt format.
